        question: "Why is Java not a pure Object-Oriented Language?",
        answer: "Java has support for primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int, float long, and double."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is Java a platform independent language?",
        answer: "Java was developed in such a way that it does not depend on any hardware or software due to the face that it compiles to byte-code, which is platform independent, to be ran on multiple systems. The system just needs the JRE installed on it."
